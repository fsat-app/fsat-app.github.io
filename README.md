# FGM Self-Assessment Tool

A visual application for self diagnosing female genital mutilation/cutting through watercolors.

## Overview

This visual self-assessment tool aims to improve communication, screening, information access, care, and documentation. It can also be used for prevalence studies.

It features watercolor illustrations by Florine Guenat based on selected photographs from Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in Children and Adolescents: Illustrated Guide to Diagnose, Assess, Inform and Report.

The watercolors evaluated in a study comparing women’s self-assessment of their FGM/C type with the WHO classification identified through specialist examination.

## Purpose

This project aims to:

- Support women and girls in visually identifying potential FGM/C types.
- Strengthen communication in clinical or counselling settings.
- Improve early screening and guide individuals toward appropriate care.
- Facilitate documentation and reporting using standardized terminology.
- Provide a visual complement to the WHO FGM/C classification.

## Artistic and Scientific Basis

The visual materials consist of watercolor illustrations by **Florine Guenat**, inspired by selected photographs from:

> *Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in Children and Adolescents: Illustrated Guide to Diagnose, Assess, Inform and Report.*

These illustrations were evaluated in a study comparing women’s self-assessment of their FGM/C type with the classification identified through specialist examination.

## Features

- Watercolor representations reflecting different FGM/C types.
- Visual prompts that support self-assessment and structured reporting.
- Neutral, non-directive interface aimed at reducing bias and stigma.
- Suitable for educational, clinical, and research contexts.

## Intended Use

This tool is **not** a diagnostic instrument.  
It supports communication and awareness and must always be used alongside professional medical assessment.

## Privacy and Data 
This application is a Progressive Web App (PWA) that uses Dexie.js for local IndexedDB storage and offline functionality. All clinician and patient data is stored in the browser and never transmitted to external servers without explicit user consent. Synchronization is anonymous: before sending, personal identifiers (names and emails) are stripped from records is shared for research purposes. Exports to CSV/Excel are pseudonymized (using hash-based composed IDs) .
For authentication, clinician passwords and security answers are hashed with SHA-256. No full-database encryption is applied, relying on browser security and isolation. Users can soft-delete records (marked for sync) or fully erase the local database at any time.
