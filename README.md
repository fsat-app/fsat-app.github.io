# FGM Self-Assessment Tool

A visual self-assessment tool designed to support communication, screening, information access, care, and documentation related to Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting (FGM/C).

## Overview

The **FGM Self-Assessment Tool** provides watercolor-based vulva illustrations to facilitate non-technical understanding and self-identification of FGM/C types.  
It aims to enhance dialogue between patients and healthcare professionals, support early screening, and improve access to reliable information in sensitive contexts.

## Purpose

This project aims to:

- Support women and girls in visually identifying potential FGM/C types.
- Strengthen communication in clinical or counselling settings.
- Improve early screening and guide individuals toward appropriate care.
- Facilitate documentation and reporting using standardized terminology.
- Provide a visual complement to the WHO FGM/C classification.

## Artistic and Scientific Basis

The visual materials consist of watercolor illustrations by **Florine Guenat**, inspired by selected photographs from:

> *Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting in Children and Adolescents: Illustrated Guide to Diagnose, Assess, Inform and Report.*

These illustrations were evaluated in a study comparing women’s self-assessment of their FGM/C type with the classification identified through specialist examination.

## Features

- Watercolor representations reflecting different FGM/C types.
- Visual prompts that support self-assessment and structured reporting.
- Neutral, non-directive interface aimed at reducing bias and stigma.
- Suitable for educational, clinical, and research contexts.

## Intended Use

This tool is **not** a diagnostic instrument.  
It supports communication and awareness and must always be used alongside professional medical assessment.
